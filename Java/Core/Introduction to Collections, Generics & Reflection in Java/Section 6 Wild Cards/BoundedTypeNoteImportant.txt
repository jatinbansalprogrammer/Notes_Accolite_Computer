ArrayList<? extends Number> list = new ArrayList<>();
	1. We can't add items to the list as list may be 
		ArrayList<? extends Number> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		ArrayList<? extends Number> list = new ArrayList<Double>();
	2. We can remove items from the list.
		ArrayList<? extends Number> list = new ArrayList<Integer>();
		list.remove(0);
			as in remove(index) doesn't matter what is the type of items.
	3. We can read items from the list. 
			as in case of reading, the items' type doesn't matter.
			But we have to use temp var as Number bcoz we don't know the exact type of items.

ArrayList<? super Number> list = new ArrayList<>();
	1. We can add Number or its sub-type items bcoz the assigned list is of the following type.
			ArrayList<? super Number> list = new ArrayList<Number>();
			ArrayList<? super Number> list = new ArrayList<Serializable>();
			ArrayList<? super Number> list = new ArrayList<Object>();
			So, followings are fine
			list.add(new Integer(2));
			list.add(new Double(3.3));
			as 2, and 3.3 are of type Number
